Still to-do:
 - Improve the first map
 - More maps
 - More enemy types
 - More weapons
 - Improve enemy textures
 - Possibly refactor into a set of libraries with separate game and controls and physics and rendering logic, allowing the same maps and other assets to be used in a 2D top-down game, for instance

Done:
 (756a0dbc) Replace all textures with custom ones, for copyright reasons
 (c8a4cb22) Add weapons
 (29475ef7) Add a HUD
 (02dd60e2) Add a health system
 (02dd60e2, improved in b6af308) Add enemies with some form of AI
 (8e451eb6) Refactor the world format to a single binary file (allowing for things such as:  more than 15 distinct textures, a flag for if a tile is a door rather than a separate tileset, etc) and write a map editor
