Still to-do:
 - Replace all textures with custom ones, for copyright reasons
 - Add weapons
 - Add a HUD
 - Add a health system
 - Add enemies with some form of AI
 - Basically turn this into a game?
 - Refactor the world format to a single binary file (allowing for things such as:  more than 15 distinct textures, a flag for if a tile is a door rather than a separate tileset, etc) and write a map editor
